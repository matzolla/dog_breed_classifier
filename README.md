Hello guys in this repository we are going to classify dog_breeds (pedigree) in french using a pretrained model either alexnet, resnet or vgg-16
-we start importing our dataset as shown in the pet_images(40 images of dogs)
## The gets_input_args.py
-The gets_input_args.py  is the python script which takes in our arguments while running the programm
in the python shell
1. it takes in the folder of the pretrained model architecture **(vgg-16,alexnet,resnet)**
2. the .txt for the dognames.txt file
3. the directory for the pet_image folder

## The check_image.py

- The check_image.py is the main program file, changes are 
Done in this file once the different scripts are
implemented progressively

## The classifier.py

-The classifier.py is a script containing the different
Pretrained model architecture as previously explained
**Choose** only one architecture

### The rest of the files

-The scripts are well 
Explained to commit different changes in the main 
**check_images.py**
